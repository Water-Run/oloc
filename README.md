# oloc: One Line of Calculation

> Under Development  

***`oloc` is a simple Python library that provides evaluation functionality for basic mathematical expressions.*** If your program needs to integrate user-input calculations (e.g., a simple scientific calculator), `oloc` is an extremely practical tool.  
**You can install `oloc` via `pip`**:  

```bash
pip install oloc
```

**`oloc` is very easy to use.** For example, here's a simple calculation example:  

```python
import oloc
print(oloc.calculate('1+2/3*(4/5-0.5)pi')) # Output: 6/5π
```

***Features of oloc***:  
- **Accurate results ensured by fractional arithmetic**  
- **Built-in support for algebraic functions and irrational numbers**  
- **Highly compatible with diverse input formats, symbols, and natural expressions**  
- **Customizable symbol and function mappings for flexible input**  
- **Supports fractions, decimals, mixed numbers, and repeating decimals**  
- **Allows comments directly within expressions**  
- **Precise error reporting with detailed suggestions**  
- **Cleanly formatted output and step-by-step results**  
- **Supports multiple data type conversions with adjustable precision**  
- **Includes computation timeout for safety**
