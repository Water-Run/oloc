# oloc: One Line of Calculation

> Under Development  

`oloc` is a simple Python library that provides evaluation functionality for basic mathematical expressions. If your program needs to integrate user-input calculations (e.g., a simple scientific calculator), `oloc` is an extremely practical tool.  
You can install `oloc` via `pip`:  

```bash
pip install oloc
```

`oloc` is very easy to use. For example, here's a simple calculation example:  

```python
import oloc
print(oloc.calculate('1+2/3*(4/5-0.5)')) # Output: 6/5
```

***Features of oloc***:  
- **Accurate calculations based on fractional arithmetic** 
- **Built-in support for algebraic functions and irrational numbers**  
- **Highly compatible with diverse input formats and notations**  
- **Allows comments within expressions**  
- **Clear and precise error messages with suggestions**
