# oloc: One Line of Calculation

> Under Development  

`oloc` is a simple Python library that provides evaluation functionality for basic mathematical expressions. If your program needs to integrate user-input calculations (e.g., a simple scientific calculator), `oloc` is an extremely practical tool.  
You can install `oloc` via `pip`:  

```bash
pip install oloc
```

`oloc` is very easy to use. For example, here's a simple calculation example:  

```python
import oloc
print(oloc.calculate('1+2/3*(4/5-sin(Ï€/2))')) # Output: 13/15
```

***Features of oloc***:  
- Lightweight and extremely easy to use  
- Realization of common basic arithmetic operations  
- Accurate results based on fractional arithmetic   
- High compatibility with various inputs  
- Clear and complete exception alerts
