# Installation and Basic Usage  

## Installation  

`oloc` is available on PyPi. Therefore, you can install `oloc` using the command:  

```bash
pip install oloc
```  

Then, import `oloc` into your project:  

```python
import oloc
```

## Basic Usage  

**Perform calculations using `oloc.calculate()`**. Pass your expression as the argument to the function.  
For basic usage, you can treat the result as a string and convert it to `float` or `int` if needed.  

```python
import oloc
oloc.calculate("1+1") # Output: 2
oloc.calculate("-1/2+1/3") # Output: -1/6
oloc.calculate("sqrt(1/4)-(1/âˆš2)^2") # Output: 0
```

If you want to access step-by-step calculation results, refer to the `result` attribute of the object returned by `oloc.calculate()`. It is a list of strings that contains the step-by-step results in sequential order.
